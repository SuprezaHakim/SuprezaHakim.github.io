                    My journey with technology didn't start in a classroom; it started with curiosity. 
                    Since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by how things work "under the hood." 
                    I started teaching myself coding languages like <strong>C, Java, and Python</strong> 
                    early on, treating every error message as a puzzle to be solved rather than a failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This passion for logic led me to join my high school's <strong>Robotics Team</strong>. 
                    There, I realized that code doesn't just live on a screen—it moves the world. 
                    I transitioned from writing simple scripts to programming physical hardware, 
                    collaborating with mechanical teams, and solving real-time engineering problems under pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from coding and robotics, I enjoy <strong>Cooking</strong> and playing vidoe games like <strong>Horizon</strong> in my free time.
